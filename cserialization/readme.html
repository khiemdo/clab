<h2><span class="red">Introduction</span></h2>

<p>This is a library for serializing structures in C. It will convert
a memory range (usually a struct or array) from binary data to a
human-readable representation. It can later parse the serialized
format and recreate the same structure in memory.</p>

<p>The code is available under the &quot;zlib license&quot; (free for
almost any use) and has no dependencies other than the C standard
library. This documentation
is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC-BY-NC-SA</a>.</p>



<h2><span class="red">Background</span></h2>
<p>Most programs require file input and output to do anything
useful. While it is possible to write data directly from memory to
disk (using <code>fwrite</code>, for example), this has several
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li>The output will be in binary form. Viewing and editing will
require special tools (such as a hex editor) and intimate knowledge of
the byte layout.</li>

<li>It's not portable; it relies on data types being a
certain length, but these can vary between implementations. It is
possible to specify byte sizes (<code>int*_t</code> and others) but
this might not be desirable in all cases. There are also endianness
issues where bytes appear in different order between
architectures.</li>

<li>Pointers. These are just arbitrary locations in memory,
unique to the running process and useless outside it. Invalid pointers
will corrupt or crash the program. Exporting raw pointers is not an
option.</li>

</ul>

<p>This library provides a solution to the problems above.</p>




<h2><span class="red">Output format</span></h2>

<p>The serialized format uses a roughly C-like syntax. It can
represent numbers as well as text and provides backslash \escaping for
non-printable characters. A shortcut notation (&quot;syntactic
sugar&quot;) is provided to store strings in a convenient way. The output is in plaintext it should be safe to move between
different architectures (regular encodings sti).</p>

<p>You can use C-style <code>/* */</code> comments for debugging and
taking notes; these are ignored during the inflation process.</p>

<p>Pointers will be replaced with hardware-independent identifiers
when they are saved and restored upon loading. Several pointers can
address the same memory without creating
duplicates <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a> in the serialized
data. Structures can point at each other, at themselves, or at
specific fields within themselves; for this reason the library is well
suited for linked lists, trees and even cyclic graphs. (Of course,
pointers can also be null.)</p>

<p>Arrays can be static (fixed size) or dynamic (pointer + index),
with facilities for retrieving the element count. It is possible to
define ragged arrays (pointers to pointers) and null-terminated arrays.</p>

<p>In addition to this each translator can specify a handler function
for custom output that can not be expressed with the serializer
syntax. For example, you might want to include a base64-coded image.</p>

<p>Deflation and inflation can be used independently. The library can
save and load &quot;documents&quot; in an application, but it can also
be used only for input or output (debug dumps, for example). Some of
the string functions can also be used on their own, though there are
probably more complete libraries for that.</p>

<p><a name="footnote1">[1]</a> When using the "string" type no pointer
substitution is performed and several copies of the same string might
be created. To get around this, define the field as a reference to a
null-terminated char array.</p>







<h2><span class="red">Translation</span></h2>

<p><img src="conversion.png" alt="Illustration showing an example conversion process"><br/></p>

<p>To serialize a structure, the programmer must provide one or more
<em>translator</em>. This is a special structure describing the
memory layout of the data to be converted. Translators are
bidirectional; the same rules are used for both deflation (to text)
and inflation (to binary). A translator can contain any number of
<em>fields</em>. Each field has:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <em>tag</em> to identify it</li>
<li>a memory <em>offset</em> from the start of the structure</li>
<li>a <em>type</em> that determines how the field will be interpreted</li>
</ul>

<p>Primitive types (int, char, etc) will treat the offset as the location
of a member variable of that type. In practice, the address will be
casted according to the type sizes of the system; if <code>sizeof(int)</code> is
four bytes it will print the number present at those four bytes.</p>

<p>The primitive types available are: <code>short</code>, <code>ushort</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>uint</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>ulong</code>, <code>size_t</code>, <code>time_t</code>, <code>intptr_t</code>, <code>uint8_t</code>, <code>uint16_t</code>, <code>uint32_t</code>, <code>int8_t</code>, <code>int16_t</code>, <code>int32_t</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>ldouble</code>.</p>

<p><code>string</code> is a special type; it will
convert <code>char</code> arrays to a convenient representation,
escaping special characters (<code>\</code>, <code>&quot;</code>,
newline and nonprintable) with backslashes.</p>

<p><em>Static arrays</em> (where the size is known at compile time)
can be defined by specifying a <code>repeat</code> count for a
field.</p>

<p>When serializing a fixed-size array, you must provide the size (in
bytes) of all elements. When serializing a dynamic array you provide
the size of only one element; inflation will automatically allocate as
many as are needed.</p>

<p><em>Dynamic arrays</em> must be defined as a type of their
own. These differ from static arrays in that they can be variable
length at run-time; thus, they must be declared as pointers. When
parsing a dynamic array, a field tag with a <code>@</code> followed
by <em>the same name as the array</em> will be used to store the
number of elements read. Example: with the fields <code>int
@array;</code> and <code>char[] array</code>, <code>@array</code> will
contain the number of characters read into <code>array</code> from
input.</p>

<p>User-defined types (anything that isn't a primitive) will be
replaced by <em>references</em>. These follow the
form <code>#n.f[a]</code> where <code>n</code> is a serial number
identifying the structure, <code>f</code> a field tag and <code>a</code> an
array index in that tag. If no <code>a</code> is present it will resolve
to the first (or only) element of <code>f</code>, if <code>f</code> is omitted
it will resolve to the starting address of the containing structure
itself.</p>





<h2><span class="red">How it works</span></h2>

<p>Serialization (deflation) takes a pointer to one structure as input and
will output a deep copy conversion; every reference to other
structures will include that structure as well (if the destination
type is included in the translator list). It is easiest to keep
all data in a hierarchy under a single struct or array. Entirely
separate structures can be serialized individually, but they will only
connect references within the same &quot;job&quot;. Serialization will
not alter the source data in memory.</p>

<p><img src="deflate.png" alt="Illustration showing serialization of a tree structure"></p>

<p>The process will first collapse the input to a flat meta-format
(internally these are called <em>holders</em>; besides structure
pointers they also hold some information about types and array
counts). It will then work through each structure in order, generate a
text representation that it prints to the job buffer. This utilises a
variety of type conversions and is also where pointers are converted
to references.</p>

<p><img style="float:right; padding-left: 20px;" src="inflate.png" alt="Illustration showing deserialization">Deserialization (inflation) works the
other way. It will read all data into a list of holders, allocate
memory for the structures and convert primitives from text back to
binary numbers. References will be gathered in a list
of <em>substitution pointers</em> that are later used to re-establish
pointers the way they are intended. If type errors are detected at
this stage the process will abort.</p>

<p>It will try to preserve type integrity and not link incompatible
structures. For example, an <code>int</code> pointer will not point to
a <code>long</code> or to another <code>int</code> pointer (even if C
itself allows such casts).</p>

<h2><span class="red">Getting started</span></h2>

<p>To use this library, add <code>serialize.c</code> to be compiled
into your project and <code>#include &quot;serialize.h&quot;</code>
where you wish to use it.</p>

<p>The <code>example*.c</code> files contain tutorial examples that
demonstrate the library function.</p>

<p><code>demo.c</code> in the distribution provides more example code
and a couple of test functions for the library.</p>






<h2><span class="red">What it doesn't do</span></h2>

<ul>

<li>It's not &quot;intelligent&quot;; it won't magically understand
data structure but needs to be told how to interpret them.</li>

<li>It's not overly optimized or space conservative. Serializing
thousands of structures will take a while. However, processing time is
proportional to the input since each structure only needs to be
visited once. The output format is verbose, but meant to be readable.</li>

<li>It cannot serialize function pointers, open files and sockets,
etc.</li>

<li>It doesn't detect overflows; if you are storing really big numbers
and moving these between systems with differing type sizes, they might
not fit.</li>

<li><a name="notjson">It's not JSON</a>. JSON has many uses but does
not fit this purpose; among other things, it lacks a way to represent
object references. While this format could be adapted to be 90%
JSON-compatible it would be point(er)less since other JSON
applications still wouldn't understand what to make of the data.</li>

</ul>

<h2><span class="red">The future (to do)</span></h2>

<ul>
<li>Resolve subst ptrs into dynamic arrays</li>
<li>Rewrite/clean up test cases</li>
<li>Document the ser_ialize() options</li>
<li>Input and output directly through file pointers</li>
<li>An easy way to handle unions</li>
<li>Output formatting flags: bitmask, hex, enumerations...</li>
<li>Custom field readers</li>
</ul>


<h2><span class="red">History</span></h2>

<p><strong>Version 0.4</strong> (2013-01-13)<br/>Removed pointer redirection (<code>-&gt;</code>); substitution pointers are now resolved in another way. Primitives can be serialized on their own (whatever good that will do). <code>ser_new_field()</code> will only take a single offset instead of dummy pointers. <code>bool</code> can be serialized (<code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are considered 1 and 0). Type safety: <code>ser_parse()</code> must be told what type to expect and will fail if it structure #1 does not match. Pointers will not be re-linked if the destination type does not match the reference. <code>null</code> made case-insensitive. Fixed bugs with <code>uint</code> and <code>time_t</code> (it is now assumed to be signed).</p>

<p><strong>Version 0.3</strong> (2012-12-13)<br/>Pointer redirection (if a pointer points within another serialized structure, the memory won't be duplicated. Fixed a bug with element counts. Added support for floating-point numbers (experimental).</p>

<p><strong>Version 0.2</strong> (2012-12-06)<br/>First public release.</p>
